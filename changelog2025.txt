03-01-2025:
Refactor the texture and sampler table, try to let them create exact length of the actual texture counts for release build.
Improved RT mipmaping a bit. Fixed the mesh asset UI for mesh renderer.
Next is to try temporal denoise for RT reflection, it's still needed for bump normal reflection.

04-01-2025:
Fixed material bugs when connecting a texture node, as it didn't refresh properly.

Next is to do the ray tracing reflection denoise, two ways to try:
-Generate mipmap for scene normal, let it reflect the ray with smoother normals.
-Extra compute shader pass to do soft RT reflection. Use a 3x3 or 5x5 mask to do adaptive min/max filtering.
If average lumin is leaning max lumin, use the max result, otherwise use the min lumin. This might affect surfaces without bump normal though.

07-01-2025:
Fixed texture recreation behavior. Previous code refactoring broke the functionality.

09-01-2025:
Did the normal vector refine for ray tracing use. It can reduce the noise indeed!
But also introducing a few micro glitches, especially on vertex normals.
Try if refine the eye(reflect) vector instead of normal is better!

10-01-2025:
Done the reflect vector smooth, result looks good.
I also fixed a bug in CollectLightCS, ring buffer is still needed to avoid flickering.

14-06-2025:
Refactor the shader management, which includes shader output path and hash.
Added UpsampleComputeShader implementation, I am going to move the fill code from both RT shadow/reflection to another pass.

15-06-2025:
Moved the upsample code from both RT shadow/reflection to a standalone pass.
Refactor the vkCmdPushConstant() calls into GraphBuilder.

21-07-2025:
Refactor FBX importer code and make it import cameras/lights as well.
Need to test it with a new interior scene.

22-07-2025:
Another big refactoring which includes separate FBX import UI from mesh dialog, and fullfill cameras/lights import.
Importing goes well but I need to find a better asset, Wood_Interior is missing texture reference.
I should consider adding a default cubemap/skylight. It's still dark with dir light only if there is no other light sources in FBX.
Also, try releasing previous scene when importing.

23-07-2025:
Make it release previous scene when importing. Now I can look for a good interior scene for the next subject.
Implemented multiple texture import, still need to check the compression setting though.
Fixed various bugs I find during FBX import..
Next to do - 
1. display source path for the mesh component drop down list.
2. Redirect to texture asset output when browsing the output path in texture creation dialog.
3. Add unit conversion option for FBX (cm or mm).
4. Study correct way to get texture names from FBX. Might just need to read the FBX sample carefully for other weird thing happened too.

24-07-2025:
Fixed various bugs during editing. Still need to try different FBX models.

25-07-2025:
Simplified fbx import process. It will now iterate all triangles and collect all mesh infos at once.
Still need to debug for certain meshes. Two more models were imported well! I think some assets are just bad for use.

27-08-2025:
Add the ability to select GPU used for rendering.
Next I will try to refactor config load/save structures.

28-08-2025:
Implemented a simple IniManager.
Refactor constness of string paramaters in UHUtilities functions.

29-09-2025:
Minor optimizations and code refactor.
Shader cache bugfix and improvement.

30-09-2025:
Minor fix for adding renderers after FBX import.
Minor fix for sky lighting update after loading a scene.
Allow HDR texture to be used as normal map.

01-10-2025:
More code refactor and bugfixes.. Such as allowing EXR normal map, sky light refresh..etc.
Add a new test scene for indirect lighting study.
Redundant rendering table and buffer are removed.
Add VRAM usage profiling.

08-10-2025:
Minor fix and refactor for smooth scene normal pass.
For now it prevents smooth normal on pixels without bump.
Rename GSceneMip as GSceneExtraData for it's purpose.

09-10-2025:
Don't think a mixed usage is a good idea. So I revert the GSceneMip change and separate another data buffer.
RT and GBuffer code refactoring. Make it possible to render to integer buffer.

06-11-2025:
Minor fix for RT reflection sampling, should consider screen mip instead env cube mip.
Increase scene data buffer size to 16 bits and store instance ID in object passes.

18-11-2025:
Refactor parallel threads implementation. Now the system will always allocate threads at max cpu logical cores number.
But for rendering submitters, it's still capped at user setting and an internal value.

19-11-2025:
Added texture array support for render textures. Ready for creating RT indirect lighting resources.

20-11-2025:
Separated indirect lighting from light pass to another new pass.
Refactor some resource barriers for performance.

24-11-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation.

25-11-2025:
Remove the instance id output in shaders for now.

26-11-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Added shader pass and got some results!
Next is to compose the multi-frame results in the indirect light pass.

27-11-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Applied the result in the object passes.
Next is to blur the result as it looks too similar as the reflection now.
Also need to try storing tracing result in the world space instead of screen space..
Fixed a hidden dangling pointer bug when releasing the render textures.

28-11-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Still refining the formula.
It's getting better! The most difficult part to figure out is the shadows for indirect lighting (not occlusion).
If the light is bounce from shadowed position, it should have lower intensity.
Okay~almost done the lighting calculation part. Attenuation should be considered properly now.
Next is to try storing results in world space UV for cache/stabilization purpose.

29-11-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Applied realtime indirect occlusion in reflection pass and transparent pass.
Separated PCSS parameters from system constant to another standable constant.
Next is to think about world space storage for IL lights..

01-12-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Was mostly doing code refactoring and aim for 3D volume render texture creation.
Also corrected the RTAO calculation. Next is to try converting the implementation to voxel-based so I can store the results in a volume.

02-12-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Converting to voxel-based tracing and see if there are any issues.
Still need to sort out something!

03-12-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Voxel-based tracing can look too low in quality due to the volume size.
Maybe trying a quality multipler...No! Probably not a great idea to do voxel-based tracing, as the quality couldn't match what I need.
There could also have potential memory cost with volume based method. Next is to do the softing.

04-12-2025:
Carry on RT indirect light implementation. Convert to a 2-frame method that shoots 2 rays per frame. (Still 4 samples overall)
Though this increased the GPU time per frame, the ghosting can be fixed easily by sampling motion vector.
Next I will try caching the hitT in the world space, at least improve the performance for a bit.

08-12-2025:
Turns out the hitT cache didn't help much. As the main perf issue is from the hit group material fetch.
Let me rework the cache later and improve the quality first.

09-12-2025:
Quality improvements for ray tracing. But find a weird ghosting bug from RT shadows..need to check what's wrong.
Fixed! After RT when it's going to do the upsample pass, a resource barrier is missed and caused ghosting.

10-12-2025:
Removing extra upsample pass for RT shadows. Not sure why they were needed before.
Found a big flaw in the RT shadow implementation - the shadow attenuation are shared for ALL lights.
That will cause shadowed pixel relative to certain light receives the light if 'any' light has no shadow.
I will reimplement RT shadow and rename it as RT direct light..just do lighting calculation after tracing.

11-12-2025:
BIG rework on RT direct lighting. As well as other RT optimizations. A few notes
- RTDL doesn't look good sometimes with half quality.
- RTIL still needs some performance hack.
- Translucent lighting issue.
Forget it. At this point I am targeting opaque objects. Translucent shadow/IL needs to be redone afterward.

13-12-2025:
Fixed a precision bug about point light culling. Sphere-sphere intersection isn't good enough, has to be a strict sphere-frustum check.
Carried on lighting rework..for the best of two worlds, I think I can only select the max influence light shadows at the moment.
That is, only one light will be chosen for RT shadows per pixel. Or allow a few RT shadows per pixel. (E.g. 4~8)

14-12-2025:
Reconstructed correct RT shadow for directional lights! Next is to deal with positional lights.
Finally done the rework for shadows.
