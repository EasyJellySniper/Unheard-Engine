03-01-2025:
Refactor the texture and sampler table, try to let them create exact length of the actual texture counts for release build.
Improved RT mipmaping a bit. Fixed the mesh asset UI for mesh renderer.
Next is to try temporal denoise for RT reflection, it's still needed for bump normal reflection.

04-01-2025:
Fixed material bugs when connecting a texture node, as it didn't refresh properly.

Next is to do the ray tracing reflection denoise, two ways to try:
-Generate mipmap for scene normal, let it reflect the ray with smoother normals.
-Extra compute shader pass to do soft RT reflection. Use a 3x3 or 5x5 mask to do adaptive min/max filtering.
If average lumin is leaning max lumin, use the max result, otherwise use the min lumin. This might affect surfaces without bump normal though.

07-01-2025:
Fixed texture recreation behavior. Previous code refactoring broke the functionality.

09-01-2025:
Did the normal vector refine for ray tracing use. It can reduce the noise indeed!
But also introducing a few micro glitches, especially on vertex normals.
Try if refine the eye(reflect) vector instead of normal is better!

10-01-2025:
Done the reflect vector smooth, result looks good.
I also fixed a bug in CollectLightCS, ring buffer is still needed to avoid flickering.

14-06-2025:
Refactor the shader management, which includes shader output path and hash.
Added UpsampleComputeShader implementation, I am going to move the fill code from both RT shadow/reflection to another pass.

15-06-2025:
Moved the upsample code from both RT shadow/reflection to a standalone pass.
Refactor the vkCmdPushConstant() calls into GraphBuilder.

21-07-2025:
Refactor FBX importer code and make it import cameras/lights as well.
Need to test it with a new interior scene.

22-07-2025:
Another big refactoring which includes separate FBX import UI from mesh dialog, and fullfill cameras/lights import.
Importing goes well but I need to find a better asset, Wood_Interior is missing texture reference.
I should consider adding a default cubemap/skylight. It's still dark with dir light only if there is no other light sources in FBX.
Also, try releasing previous scene when importing.

23-07-2025:
Make it release previous scene when importing. Now I can look for a good interior scene for the next subject.
Implemented multiple texture import, still need to check the compression setting though.
Fixed various bugs I find during FBX import..
Next to do - 
1. display source path for the mesh component drop down list.
2. Redirect to texture asset output when browsing the output path in texture creation dialog.
3. Add unit conversion option for FBX (cm or mm).
4. Study correct way to get texture names from FBX. Might just need to read the FBX sample carefully for other weird thing happened too.

24-07-2025:
Fixed various bugs during editing. Still need to try different FBX models.

25-07-2025:
Simplified fbx import process. It will now iterate all triangles and collect all mesh infos at once.
Still need to debug for certain meshes. Two more models were imported well! I think some assets are just bad for use.

27-08-2025:
Add the ability to select GPU used for rendering.
Next I will try to refactor config load/save structures.

28-08-2025:
Implemented a simple IniManager.
Refactor constness of string paramaters in UHUtilities functions.
