Refactor the texture and sampler table, try to let them create exact length of the actual texture counts for release build.
Improved RT mipmaping a bit. Fixed the mesh asset UI for mesh renderer.
Next is to try temporal denoise for RT reflection, it's still needed for bump normal reflection.

Fixed material bugs when connecting a texture node, as it didn't refresh properly.

Next is to do the ray tracing reflection denoise, two ways to try:
-Generate mipmap for scene normal, let it reflect the ray with smoother normals.
-Extra compute shader pass to do soft RT reflection. Use a 3x3 or 5x5 mask to do adaptive min/max filtering.
If average lumin is leaning max lumin, use the max result, otherwise use the min lumin. This might affect surfaces without bump normal though.

Fixed texture recreation behavior. Previous code refactoring broke the functionality.
