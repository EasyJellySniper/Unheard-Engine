14-01-2024: 
Add gaussian blur pass. The next is to try half-sized blurring or even quarter-sized if performance issue is there.
15-01-2024: 
Make gaussian blur calculate at lower resolution (not just half-sized).
Also corrected a few performance profiles.

19-01-2024: 
Fixed the wrong tone map data array size. Made min image count follow GMaxFrameInFlight value.
Removed the PresentWait and PresentId usage. They caused a high cpu usage.
21-01-2024: 
Started adding refraction material parameter and binding refraction textures.
Next is to do refraction calculation.

25-01-2024: 
Started adding refraction calculation. But the blurred scene quality is too low IMO.
Next is to try a higher resolution blurred scene with a lower blur radius.
Fixed the material buffer size issue when the parameter changes.
Input guard for all other editor dialogs.

27-01-2024: Continue implementing the refraction material. First version of refraction material is done. Looks solid!
Also pushed constants to blur shader successfully, saved constant buffer creation.
